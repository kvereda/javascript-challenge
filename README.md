Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search


Created a basic HTML web page.

Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Included a column for: date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.

Using a date form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.



Level 2: Multiple Search Categories 

Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time,
city,
state,
country,
shape.
